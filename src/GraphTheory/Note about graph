A graph is a set of node and edges
the node which holds data is called vertex and the line connecting 2 vertices is called edge
connected graph :

cycle : a cycle is a graph where first and last vertices is same
type 4
1 : undirected
2 : directed
3 : weighted
4 : connected

memory storing system

a graph is stored in the computers memory using matrix (2d array)


next day task exercise about graph

Different types of search
1 Dfs : Depth first search

follow the theory from tutorials point based on java

depth first search

Path − Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.

Root − The node at the top of the tree is called root.
       There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.

Parent − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.

Child − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.

Leaf − The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.

Subtree − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.

Visiting − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.

Traversing − Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.

Levels − Level of a node represents the generation of a node.
         If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1,
         its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.

keys − Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.
