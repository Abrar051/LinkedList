problem from 4.8-4.12
Unlike single linked list double linked list is formed with 2 items
1 is previous and another is next
descending sort
algorithm
2 loop will run
1st loop runs current
2nd loop runs index
current will start from head
Node current=head;
while (current!=null)
{
 index=current.next
 while (index!=null)
 {
  if (current.next<index.next)
    {
    swap
    }
   index=index.next;
  }
  current=current.next;
}
