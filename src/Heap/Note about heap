A heap is a type of binary tree which has either smaller or bigger value than child
if the heap parent node is bigger than child node then all node will be smaller (max heap)
if the heap parent node is smaller the child value will increase (min heap)

The main difference is that Binary Search Tree doesnâ€™t allow duplicates, however, the Heap does.
The BST is ordered, but the Heap is not. So, if order matters, then it is better to use BST

priority queue
